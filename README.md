=======================

### About
This project is for the [Ruby Database Design assessment](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/database-basics-assessment) at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/).

The project is a shoe inventory program with an emphasis using joined tables to display the sneakers and the variety of colors that are availble for each style. It will allow you to enter a brand, a style and a color for the style. The user can then list all of the colors for each style. The user interface has been designed to run in the command line.
